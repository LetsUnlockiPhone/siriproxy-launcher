This plugin allows you to launch nearly any app on your mac.

Required!****

sudo gem install rb-appscript

You must run the above to install appscript.  Once there you can use away.  

Since this is WAY alpha, the keyphrase is: just <appname> please  

This will likely change as development moves beyond simply launching apps..  

Install:
Simply add the following to your config.yml:  

 - name: 'Spotify'
   git: 'git://github.com/bikr/siriproxy-launcher.git'
